fmAPI documentation
==========

Refer to this page for the official documentation of fmAPI.js.

Implementation
-------

Run fmAPI.js in global scope -- to achieve this, simply copy and paste the contents of the file into a new JavaScript file. This is specifically designed to run on [forumotion forums](http://forumotion.com/en), but will run on any environment with JavaScript installed, though, obviously, the script will not be useful.

fmAPI - methods
-------

`fmAPI` itself is an instance of _F that inherits from _f. The constructor names are irrelevant and are discarded after the script runs the only function it contains, a closure.

Following methods are available for `fmAPI`:

##### [toString](#toString)
##### [init](#init)
##### [getPageData](#getPageData)
##### [setProperty](#setProperty)
##### [getProperty](#getProperty)
##### [updateProperty](#updateProperty)
##### [log](#log)
##### [getURL](#getURL)
